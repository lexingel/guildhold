## GameData, part 6c: Riftbreaks (docs/design/riftbreak.md). From Act II a
## rift swells every so often: a ladder rank, a region (the camp itself from
## BREACH_CAMP_RANK up) and a countdown in days. Seal a rift of that rank or
## higher first to prevent it; otherwise it breaks, rift runs wait, and the
## guild defends in a tower-defense fight.

## 0.63: a breach is defended in a breach rift (back-to-back fights in the
## normal combat); the tower defense (scripts/defense) is parked, not deleted.
