## The tester build: what changed lately and what to try, shown on the title
## screen (newest first, a few lines each).
## The languages the game speaks: [locale, its own name for itself].
const LANGUAGES := [["en", "English"], ["tr", "Türkçe (beta)"]]

const WHATS_NEW := [
	"Book II, the Sky Beneath: after the Accord's ending (any of the three), a reply turns up on the ledger's last page, and two more acts open under the Accord Hall. Act V, the Glass Coast; Act VI, the Inverted City. 30 new foes, crossings to answer, a gate to hold, and one more choice at the end. (The new regions use recoloured art for now; their own art is coming.)",
	"New systems now arrive more gradually: the rival's moves at the third sealed rift, Crafting at the fifth, and the Daily twist at the seventh, after Act I's finale.",
	"The Grandmaster's ledger no longer hides behind bad luck: after three sealed rifts without a page (while one is waiting in the current act), the next one finds it.",
	"For playtesters: the founding screen can skip Act I, so you start with it done and can try the middle game straight away (champions, Riftbreaks, the rival's moves).",
	"There is more to Hesper's story than she has told you. Each guild that finishes Act III hears a little more of it, and those who hear all of it, from guilds that have both kept and broken the Accord, may find a third way to end it.",
	"The Vale this year: after your first guild, each new one is founded in a different year. Two of eight year modifiers (a dry year, restless rifts, the Hollow stirring in one region, a hard winter...) each change the campaign one way for better and one for worse, and the rival has a temperament: hiring, boasting or undercutting. Roll the year again for 2 Laurels; Guild > Records shows it.",
	"The Descent: a new way into the Endless Rift, turn-based, with your heroes. Go down depth after depth, each harder and better paid; every second depth ends at a pillar where a lost champion waits. Climb out any time and keep everything. Pillars also turn up on Rank B and higher rifts, and the real-time Endless Rift is still there for your champions. Act IV now asks you to free a lost champion by any of the three.",
	"Two new founding gifts for your next guild (Laurels): Veteran start begins with Act I already done, with the heroes, gear and Gold a guild has by then; Old contacts puts two Rank C recruits on the first board.",
	"Tidewalls: a guild that broke the Accord can raise walls against the Open Hollow (Guild > Management). Each makes every tide 6% weaker against the guild, and costs more than the last; Gold and Essence finally have somewhere to go in that postgame.",
	"Postgame tuning: the old Accord halls cost about half as much (all seven: 45,000 Gold and 40,000 Essence). Tides of the Open Hollow now really break every week, with three days' warning, and grow 15% stronger only with each tide you hold: losing one doesn't make the next harder.",
	"Hesper, Wen and Dobbs remember your past guilds: on a quiet payday the talk at the pay table can turn to one of them, and to the heroes it left behind.",
	"Your past guilds' banners now hang in camp, either side of the Guild Hall. Hover one for its record; click it for the Hall of Guilds.",
	"After your first guild: found the next one under a charter (Mercenary Company, Temple Order, the Lantern's Smugglers, Last of the Accord) and swear oaths for more Laurels. And the ending now sets the postgame: Keepers of the Vale restore the old Accord halls; a guild that broke the Accord holds back a tide of the Open Hollow every week. The Chronicle lists what a guild can still finish.",
	"Legacy: when your guild chooses the Accord's ending (or retires, from Act III on, under Guild > Records), it joins the Hall of Guilds. Up to two of its heroes come back as champions in your later guilds, waiting to be freed in the Endless Rift, and it leaves Laurels to spend on gifts when you found the next one.",
	"Captain Morrow is a real fight now: tougher than other bosses of his rank, and he whistles up his sellswords twice, at two-thirds and again at one-third health.",
	"Party Assembly is simpler: your party stands on four slots facing the foes. Press + on a slot to pick a hero, or drag one from the roster onto it (onto someone to swap). Each hero has a small F/B switch for the Front or Back row.",
	"The boon after an elite is now a pop-up too: one card per boon in its family's colours, with the set it would complete, Take (or keys 1-3) and Skip.",
	"After a won fight, choosing your reward is now its own pop-up: the loot as cards with every stat on its own line, who it suits, and a Take button (or keys 1-3).",
	"Move a guild between devices: Settings > Backup > Send to another device gives a short code and a QR code. Scan it with your phone, or choose Receive a guild on the title screen and type the code. A code works once, for 15 minutes.",
	"Easier to read: the game's text is now set in Lato, wider and clearer at 1080p and below, and the opening's captions sit on a dark plate in a sturdier book face. Back on Settings works again after pressing the gear a second time.",
	"The Hollow Crown Company strikes back: expose them and from Act III their sellswords ambush your rifts, and Captain Morrow waits at the bottom of a Rank C+ rift with the key he opens rifts with. A kept echo can now touch a hero who recognises what's in it (Echo-Touched); the third echo brings Ezra the Pale, and the campaign's end says what the Vale remembers. A hero's fiftieth rift gets a line in the Chronicle.",
	"New sound effects throughout (free CC0 sounds, picked by ear). The Charter War comes to a head: as Act III opens, Mother Ilse brings proof the Hollow Crown Company opens rifts for profit. Expose them or keep quiet; when Act III ends, the Crown grants its Royal Charter to the guild with the most Renown. Wen now writes a line for every hero on the Memorial, and a scene when a bond reaches its peak.",
	"The opening is narrated now, over its own music, with two new scenes: the Accord sealing a rift, and the villagers waiting for a guild. Watch it again from Settings or the Chronicle.",
	"An opening cinematic: the Night of Breaking, how the old guilds of the Accord vanished, ending on your own guild. It plays when you found a guild; watch it again from Settings or Library > Codex > Chronicle.",
	"From Act II a sealed rift sometimes leaves an echo: Essence that holds something the Hollow took from someone. Give it back to the village, or keep it. Stranger, gentler things now turn up in rifts too. And when a hero first reaches Rank B, the guild marks their new calling with a scene of its own.",
	"Act IV: the Accord Hall. After Sythrane, the posts are tiring, and the Terms of the old bargain wait at the bottom of the Endless Rift (stronger for every post you've emptied). Beat them and choose how the story ends: renew the Accord, or break it. Guilds that already finished Act III can start it now.",
	"The guild has people now. Wen the Chronicler, Dobbs the Quartermaster and Old Hesper, the last of an Accord guild, talk at the pay table every payday (see the Ledger). The rival's leader signs every move with a letter of their own, and the Crown has promised a Royal Charter to the best guild. Freeing a champion in the Endless Rift leaves a post empty: the next Riftbreak comes sooner.",
	"The story has a past now: the Broken Accord. Why the old guilds vanished on the Night of Breaking, what the champions remember of it, and pages of the Grandmaster's ledger to find in sealed rifts. Read it all in Library > Codex > Chronicle.",
	"Recruiting is a board now: new faces arrive every day and wait a few days before moving on, payday fills it, and the rival may sign your best offer first. Each card shows the recruit's attributes and born quirk. Rerolls double in price until payday. Party screens have three saved loadouts: save a party with its rows, load it in one click.",
	"The Guild Ledger runs the payroll now: put a hero on half pay to save Gold (it costs morale) or give a bonus to keep them Inspired, see the vault against payday at a glance, and who would go unpaid. Skills aimed at one foe ask which: click the foe. Any save can be deleted from Load Game.",
	"A lighter interface: cards and buttons lose their outlines (an edge now means something needs you), the main tabs moved into the header, lists and ledgers sit on a calm background, the hero page says each number once, and notices stack less. Key numbers on fight buttons are a setting now (Settings > Key hints).",
	"Act finales are real climaxes: each is built on the rank you sealed to reach it, a step harder (they had fallen below it, and a quarter of finale fights ended in the first round). The Recommended power on the party screen follows. Champion cards line up in an even grid.",
	"Inventory and Guild Management open straight on their contents: the room's art is a slim strip with its sections as buttons, and each opens where you left it.",
	"Cleaner screens on a laptop: shops, treasure, events and hazards no longer sit under the path map (it shows while you choose a path), Victory puts the rewards beside the results, the quest board fits every note, pre-fight art is shorter, and notices moved to the bottom right.",
	"Recruits: commission a hero of the role you want (3 rerolls' Gold), and each offer shows power, HP and wage. Hazards now hurt in line with the rift's rank and always pay about a fight's worth, with a chance of double. Agility gives +1.5% dodge a point (was 0.8%).",
	"From player feedback: click a foe to target it (click again to attack). Auto lasts one fight. Quick fight also opens for a Favored party and says why when it can't. Every Ability shows its numbers. Shield Bash can't stun the same foe two rounds running. Fixed Legendary relics no longer take Essence for levels (refunded). Items say which slot they take. The party screen remembers your last party and rows. Clearer Medical Bay, rewards, run summary and skill tree.",
	"The bonus for winning by hand (+30% Gold and Essence, no one down) now pays on elites, bosses and every fight on a rank you haven't sealed: the fights where playing by hand matters.",
	"Fights: Quick fight now opens on a rank once you've sealed it, so a new rank and the act finales are fought where you can see them. Auto pauses when a hero is about to fall. The bonus for winning by hand shows before every fight.",
	"Balance: from Rank E up, monsters hit harder and last longer, so a party at Recommended power now seals about 3 rifts in 5 and Deadly means it. Hero wages are 50% higher, so a big roster has to earn its keep.",
	"A new guild meets its systems one at a time: Quests after your first seal, Management after the second, then Crafting, the daily twist and the rival's moves after the third. A broke guild with fewer than 3 heroes now gets free volunteers at payday.",
	"Phones: no keyboard hints where there's no keyboard, and a larger turn-your-phone prompt.",
	"Phones: hold your phone sideways and the game now fits, with larger text and buttons and the whole fight on one screen. Press and hold anything to read what it does. A fight won by hand with no one down now pays +30% Essence as well as Gold.",
	"A guild now holds 6 heroes from the start (a party is 4), so there's a bench to choose from. Act I and Act II have new goals. The Feedback report now includes how long you've played and how your fights and runs went.",
	"Fixes from a full play-through: a foe that has wound up keeps its red warning until the blow lands, the first fight's lessons come in order, the rival's contract grab can't point at a contract that's gone, rift bosses belong to their region (no Act III boss in the Vale), and the rival keeps pace in the Renown race. New: Add strongest on the party screen.",
	"New foes and stories: six new monsters, two per region (Blight Hound, Lantern Wight, Tide Caller, Mudscale Brute, Cinder Hound, Obsidian Sentinel) in six new designed fights, and 21 new rift events, some found only in one region. Upgrading a facility, hiring a hero, levelling a champion or buying from a shop now lands with a banner and a burst of sparks.",
	"The rival acts: once a week it may court one of your heroes, dare you to seal a rift by payday, or go for a posted contract, and you decide how to answer. Hero requests and the rival's moves pop up as cards when you're home. The Ledger opens on a week board: every day to payday and what falls on it.",
	"Fewer, clearer modes: the Daily Rift is now a daily twist on the Rift Ladder (tick it and your next ladder rift, any rank, carries the day's rule and boon for bonus Essence). Echoes are gone: the Endless Rift pays Essence, and Essence levels champions (old Echoes were converted). Renown is the one race with the rival: the monthly contest counts Renown gained, and the Renown tile turns green when you lead.",
	"New loot: items roll fewer, bigger stats (two per item type), and Rare and Epic items carry a named effect such as Ambush, Thunderclap, Riposte or Renewal. Picking gear shows the Power change. Your current items are unchanged.",
	"Phase 1 of the design pass: fights fit on screen without scrolling, notices sit in the top-right corner (two at a time, click to dismiss, never over a fight), new guilds start with three heroes, one tip at a time, and a tidier Rift Hall and Ledger.",
	"Hero pages are tidier: the header is a row of chips, clicking a slot opens a pop-up of item cards (gains in green, losses in red), and the passive and build notes moved to the Skills tab.",
	"Hero pages between fights: click a hero in the rift's top bar (or Hero pages) for the same page as the Roster — gear, attribute and skill points, with tabs for the whole party. It replaces the old Gear Up panel.",
	"Riftbreak defenses have painted roads, the Defenses research stands on the war-room map, and a lost defense never touches the Gold set aside for payday. Champions' signature mods are spread evenly: each of the 12 on four champions.",
	"Riftbreaks: from Act II a rift swells now and then, with a countdown in days. Seal a rift of its rank in time to close it, or it breaks and your guild defends: build towers on the road, post your idle heroes and steer a champion. Losing costs Gold, Essence and a damaged building. New Defenses research in Guild > Manage, paid in Gold.",
	"Endless Rift level-ups are built around your champions now: each champion's signature move has two mods of its own (Aftershock, Kindled, Leech, Bulwark and more). From level 10, fuse two champions: their signatures fire together, 25% harder, and share their mods.",
	"Endless Rift: gentler when it first opens, and it grows stronger with every champion you free and every act you pass (the party screen shows its strength).",
	"Endless Rift: every champion now walks with their own animation and plays a signature move when their Call fires.",
	"Champions, reworked: 24 named champions with their own art, and each new guild meets a different 12. Three are freed by the story, nine are lost in the Endless Rift (stand in their light to free them). One oversees your rift runs with a Boon and a Call; Echoes level them up.",
	"The Endless Rift is now the champions' rift: only champions go in, each with a signature move. It pays Echoes and a little gold, and costs the guild a day.",
	"Türkçe (beta): Settings or the title screen. Menus, fights, tips, names and descriptions are all in Turkish.",
	"Settings > Hearing aid: captions for sounds that tell you something (a boss arriving, a heavy blow, a hero going down, a wind-up), and the screen's edges pulse on the biggest moments.",
	"Two heroes of the same subclass no longer look like twins: the second wears different colours, everywhere they appear.",
	"Endless Rift: fixed the field going grey after a stutter; the ground has grass, reeds, cracks and embers; the party stands out in the middle; banners no longer pile up.",
	"New look: the title, camp and Rift Hall fill the screen, with flickering torches, breathing portals, stars and fireflies; screens fade between each other and a rift opens as you step in.",
	"Endless Rift: waves every minute, elite packs with chests, archers, a Rift Warden at 20:00 to beat, evolutions, rift relics, terrain and braziers.",
	"Fights: the main actions fit one row (More holds the rest); hover to preview Momentum; winning by hand with no one down pays +30% Gold.",
	"Guild: a This-week strip in camp, hero requests to answer, a rival with a face and a monthly contest.",
	"New music, larger text, and rank rules shown in the rift.",
