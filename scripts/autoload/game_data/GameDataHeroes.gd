## (Hero.quirks, by name):
## - "born": rolled at recruitment (at most one; sets their voice),
## - "scar": left by being knocked out (up to 2; a net wound with an upside),
## - "earned": unlocked by what they've done (Hero.history `stat` >= `need`).
## `stats` {kind: value} add to the hero like skills and gear; `effects` are
## Combat.hero_effects entries. `treatable` quirks can be treated for Gold at
## the Arcane Lab.
