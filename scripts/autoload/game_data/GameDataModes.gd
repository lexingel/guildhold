## GameData, part 6: run boons, Tower of Trials, difficulties, rift events, rift ranks, Guild Management and Orders, the hamlet, features, campaign, quests, milestones, the Daily Rift.

## ---------------- Run boons ----------------
## Picked after an elite win (1 of 3), kept for the rest of that rift only.
## Each is a stat ("kind"/"value", read through Combat.boon_total) or a relic-
## style trigger (fired with the party's relic triggers). Owning 2 / 4 of a
## family adds its set bonus.
