## guild rolls CHAMPION_ROLL of them. The first three rolled are freed at the

## Rift they are the party.

## boon: party-wide while overseeing, {kind, value, name}; call: an Ability-
## shaped {name, effect, value, desc}. Both grow CHAMPION_LEVEL_POWER per
## level. mods: the two SurvivorsRun.SIG_MODS their signature can learn in the
## Endless Rift. Art: assets/champions (portraits), walk and skill frames in
## assets/survivors; the prompts that made them are in docs/art_src.
